# TRP479: Spatial Data Science for Social Scientists
(Updated for Spring 2025)

&nbsp;

This is a repository created for the University of Sheffield School of Geography and Planning module TRP479 in Spring 2025. It primarily holds the code for the Google CoLab (Python) notebooks that we will be using. Slides and other resources are linked here and available through Blackboard. 

&nbsp;

## Introduction
This module is designed to provide an introduction to the concepts and methods of ‘data science’ and, in particular, how they can be utilised in conjunction with spatial data. The module will particularly focus on applications within social sciences and demonstrate how these skills can be applied in urban contexts. The module will introduce students to how programming approaches can be used to tackle problems in data handling, data analysis, and data visualisations. This will be of particular interest to those who wish to develop their technical and analytical skills in a real-world, problem-oriented context and will add in-demand  employability skills.  It will also appeal to students who wish to understand ‘data science’ as an approach to investigating the world around us. No prior programming experience is required but students will be expected to have some familiarity with core concepts of coding through watching suggested videos or prior reading.

## Software
This module will use the Python programming language. Python is one of the most straightforward languages to learn and is widely used in data science. It also integrates with GIS software through the ArcPy and PyQGIS packages. We will be using a computational notebook approach (Google Colab), this allows you to write and execute code in an interactive environment within your browser and means you do not need to install any additional software.

## Staff
The module leader is Jacob Macdonald (j.macdonald@sheffield.ac.uk) and will also be co-delivired with Ruth Hamilton (r.hamilton@sheffield.ac.uk). Please contact us if you have questions about the module.
