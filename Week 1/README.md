# Week 1: Introduction to Data Science and Programming

In this session we'll introduce the course outline, assessments and structure. We'll then talk about the history and context of data science and programming. Our workshops will introduce the tools for our coding in this module (Google CoLab) and some of the basics of working in our chosen programming language (Python).
